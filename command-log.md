# Command Execution Log

This file logs all commands executed during the multi-session X11 setup process.

**Session Start**: 2025-09-09
**Objective**: Configure additional console X session for VR applications while maintaining VNC session

## Commands Executed

### Initial System Analysis
```bash
# Check current display manager status
systemctl status display-manager
# Result: Unit display-manager.service could not be found.

# Check running X servers and display managers
ps aux | grep -E "(Xorg|Xvnc|gdm|lightdm|sddm)"
# Result: Found Xvnc :13 running for VNC session

# Check current user sessions
who
# Result: swim pts/1 2025-09-09 08:53 (192.168.178.194) - VNC/SSH session

# Check X11 configuration directory
ls /etc/X11/
# Result: Contains xorg.conf.d, xinit, default-display-manager

# Check default display manager
cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager
# Result: /usr/sbin/gdm3

# Check GDM3 display manager status
systemctl status gdm3
# Result: GDM3 is inactive (dead) - no console GUI session currently running

### Console X Session Setup
# Start GDM3 display manager for console GUI
sudo systemctl start gdm3
# Result: Command executed successfully

# Verify GDM3 started successfully
systemctl status gdm3
# Result: GDM3 active (running) since 11:58:29

# Check running X servers (both VNC and console)
ps aux | grep -E "(Xorg|Xvnc)" | grep -v grep
# Result: 
# - Xvnc :13 (VNC session) - existing
# - Xorg vt1 (console session) - newly started by GDM

### NVIDIA GPU Access Testing
# Test NVIDIA GPU access on console display :0
DISPLAY=:0 nvidia-smi
# Result: ✅ NVIDIA RTX 4090 detected and accessible
# GPU processes: gnome-remote-desktop, Xorg, gnome-shell active

# Test OpenGL access on console display :0
env DISPLAY=:0 glxinfo | head -15
# Result: ❌ Authorization required - need user session on console

# Enable GDM3 for persistent service
sudo systemctl enable gdm3
# Result: Static unit, activation handled by systemd

### Console Session Access Issue
# Check current foreground console
sudo fgconsole
# Result: 1 (on tty1)

# Check GDM processes and VT usage
ps aux | grep gdm
# Result: GDM is running greeter session on tty1, not user login
# Issue: Ctrl+Alt+F1 shows black screen - GDM greeter not displaying properly
```

# Phase 1: Console GUI Status Check - Tue Sep  9 12:35:05 PM CEST 2025
sudo fgconsole
# Result: Console is on tty7 (GUI session)
ls /sys/class/drm/
# Result: Multiple display ports available - DP-1,2,3 and HDMI-A-1,2
cat /sys/class/drm/card0-*/status
# Checked individual display port status

# Testing console GUI application launch
# CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY - Tue Sep  9 12:35:53 PM CEST 2025
# ✅ Console GUI Session: Active on tty7 (session 11)
# ✅ RDP Session: Active on localhost:10.0 (Xvnc :13)
# ✅ Physical Display: HDMI-A-2 connected and available
# ✅ NVIDIA GPU: Accessible from console session
# CONSOLE LOGIN ISSUE - Tue Sep  9 12:43:43 PM CEST 2025
# User reports: Console login hangs for current user
# CONSOLE LOGIN ISSUE - Tue Sep  9 12:45:12 PM CEST 2025
# User reports: Console login hangs for user 'swim'
# ✅ SUCCESS: New user 'jpvr' can login to console without issues
# DIAGNOSIS: Issue specific to user 'swim' - likely Xvnc session conflict
ps aux | grep swim.*Xvnc
loginctl list-sessions
# ANALYSIS: User 'swim' has multiple sessions:
# - Session 11: seat0 tty7 (console GUI - HANGS on login)
# - Xvnc :13: VNC/RDP session (WORKING)
# - Session 13: User 'jpvr' on tty8 (WORKS FINE)
sudo -u jpvr nvidia-smi
# ✅ SOLUTION CONFIRMED: User 'jpvr' has full GPU access on console
# RECOMMENDATION: Use 'jpvr' for console VR testing, 'swim' for RDP

ps aux | grep -E "(Xorg|Xvnc|gdm)"
# Result: Found jpvr X session :0 on vt1, GDM greeter on tty1, VNC :10 for swim
cat /sys/class/drm/card0-*/status
# Result: One display connected (HDMI-A-2 from previous logs)
# ISSUE IDENTIFIED: jpvr X session running with VNC resolution instead of physical display
# GDM3 restarted successfully - greeter should be on tty1
# USER CONFUSION ISSUE - Console asking for swim instead of jpvr after GDM restart
# SOLUTION: Console should show GDM greeter on tty1 - select jpvr user instead of swim
# BLACK SCREEN ISSUE: No greeter visible, just cursor on tty1
# DIAGNOSIS: NVIDIA driver unable to detect physical display for DPI computation
# WORKAROUND: Stopped GDM, console should show text login - log in as jpvr then run startx
# Console login also shows black screen - system appears headless
# ROOT CAUSE FOUND: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-headless.conf has UseDisplayDevice=none
# CAREFUL: Need to preserve VNC setup while enabling physical display
# New config failed - black screen no cursor. Reverted to original headless config
# VR REQUIREMENT: DCS needs physical console due to SteamVR/Vulkan issues with VNC
# Console switching broke displays - tty1/2 black, tty7 cursor only
# SOLUTION: Created toggle script to switch between VNC and VR modes
# SWITCHING TO VR MODE: Headless config disabled, physical display should work
# SUCCESS: VR mode enabled, jpvr logged in, setup completed
# DESKTOP SETUP: Copying applications and configs from swim to jpvr
# DESKTOP SETUP COMPLETE: Applications, Steam, and DCS shortcuts copied to jpvr

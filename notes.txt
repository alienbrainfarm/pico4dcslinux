PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION: Research & Environment Setup

This project explores getting DCS (Digital Combat Simulator) working on Pop!_OS Linux with VR working with the Pico 4 headset.

CURRENT STATUS: Phase 1 - Research & Environment Setup

QUICK START:
1. Review docs/phase1-action-items.md for day-by-day checklist
2. Check docs/phase1-research-findings.md for current technical status  
3. See docs/phase1-implementation-plan.md for complete Phase 1 guide

KEY PHASE 1 OBJECTIVES:
- Research Linux VR ecosystem (OpenXR, Monado, ALVR)
- Test Pico 4 connectivity options
- Validate DCS + Wine compatibility
- Establish performance baselines
- Document findings and create Phase 2 roadmap

MAIN TECHNICAL CHALLENGES TO INVESTIGATE:
- Wine VR API support limitations
- Pico 4 Linux driver availability  
- Performance overhead (Wine + VR)
- DCS VR mode compatibility through Wine

See docs/ directory for complete documentation.

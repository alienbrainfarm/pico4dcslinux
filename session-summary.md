# Session Summary - September 9, 2025

## Major Achievements ‚úÖ

### Complete VR Infrastructure Working
- **Steam**: Fixed webhelper login issues by correcting hardcoded /home/swim paths
- **SteamVR**: Running properly with correct OpenXR runtime configuration  
- **ALVR**: Successfully connecting Pico 4 headset to PC
- **OpenXR Runtime**: Properly configured to use SteamVR instead of Monado
- **VR Testing**: The Lab running smoothly in headset, full VR pipeline operational

### DCS World Installation Progress
- **Fresh Wine Setup**: Clean Wine prefix created under jpvr user (wine-staging 10.14)
- **DCS Installation**: Successfully installed DCS World from web installer
- **Dependencies**: Visual C++ redistributables installed for stability
- **Launch Success**: DCS launches and runs (with --force_disable_VR flag)

## Current Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### DCS Stability
- **Crash Pattern**: DCS crashes intermittently, even in non-VR mode
- **VR Launch**: Direct VR launch causes immediate crash (first exception error)
- **Dependencies**: May need additional Wine components (DirectX, .NET Framework, etc.)

## Tomorrow's Tasks üìã

1. **DCS Stability Investigation**
   - Install additional Wine dependencies (DirectX, .NET, fonts)
   - Configure Wine graphics settings (DXVK/VKD3D)
   - Test different DCS launch parameters

2. **VR Integration Testing**
   - Enable VR through DCS settings menu (safer than direct launch)
   - Test OpenVR integration with stable DCS instance
   - Configure DCS VR settings for optimal performance

3. **System Optimization**
   - Fine-tune Wine configuration
   - Optimize GPU/OpenXR runtime settings
   - Create reliable launch scripts

## Technical Environment

### VR Stack Status
```
‚úÖ Hardware: Pico 4 headset connected
‚úÖ ALVR: Streaming VR content successfully  
‚úÖ SteamVR: Runtime active and compositing
‚úÖ OpenXR: Configured for SteamVR (not Monado)
‚úÖ GPU: VR-ready and tested with The Lab
```

### DCS Stack Status
```
‚úÖ Wine: wine-staging 10.14 with Windows 10 compatibility
‚úÖ Prefix: Clean installation at ~/wine-prefixes/dcs
‚úÖ DCS: Latest version installed and launching
‚ö†Ô∏è Stability: Needs additional dependencies/configuration
‚ùå VR Mode: Crashes on direct VR launch
```

### Key Paths
- Wine prefix: `/home/jpvr/wine-prefixes/dcs`
- DCS installation: `/home/jpvr/wine-prefixes/dcs/drive_c/Program Files/Eagle Dynamics/DCS World`
- OpenXR runtime: `/home/jpvr/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/SteamVR/steamxr_linux64.json`

## Notes for Next Session
- VR infrastructure is solid and working perfectly
- Focus should be on DCS stability before attempting VR integration
- Consider trying DCS through Steam/Proton as alternative approach
- All path issues from swim‚Üíjpvr migration have been resolved

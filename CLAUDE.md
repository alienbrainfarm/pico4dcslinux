# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project explores getting DCS (Digital Combat Simulator) working on Pop!_OS Linux with VR functionality using the Pico 4 headset. This is currently a research and experimentation project in its early stages.

## Repository Structure

The repository currently contains minimal files:
- `notes.txt` - Project objectives and initial notes

## Development Status

This appears to be a new project focused on VR gaming compatibility research. No build system, source code, or development workflows have been established yet.

## Project Context

The goal is to achieve VR gaming compatibility specifically for:
- DCS (Digital Combat Simulator)
- Pop!_OS Linux distribution
- Pico 4 VR headset integration

Future development will likely involve researching and implementing solutions for Linux VR gaming, potentially including Wine/Proton configurations, VR runtime setup, and hardware compatibility layers.

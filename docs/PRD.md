# Product Requirements Document: Pico 4 DCS Linux

## 1. Project Overview

### Vision
Enable seamless VR flight simulation using DCS World on Pop!_OS Linux with Pico 4 headset support.

### Problem Statement
DCS World and VR gaming on Linux faces multiple compatibility challenges:
- Limited native Linux support for VR applications
- Complex VR runtime configuration requirements
- Pico 4 headset driver and tracking integration issues
- Performance optimization needs for VR gaming

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **VR Compatibility**: Achieve stable DCS World VR operation on Pop!_OS Linux
- **Pico 4 Integration**: Full headset functionality including 6DOF tracking and controllers
- **Performance**: Maintain acceptable framerates for comfortable VR experience
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup guide for reproducible results

### Success Metrics
- DCS World launches and runs stably in VR mode
- Pico 4 headset tracking functions correctly with minimal latency
- Frame rates consistently above 72 FPS (preferably 90+ FPS)
- Setup process documented and validated by community testing

## 3. Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- Pop!_OS 22.04+ (Ubuntu 22.04+ base)
- NVIDIA RTX 3060 or equivalent (VR-capable GPU)
- 16GB+ RAM
- USB 3.0+ ports for headset connectivity

### Software Components
- **Wine/Proton**: Windows compatibility layer
- **OpenXR Runtime**: VR API implementation
- **SteamVR**: VR platform integration (if applicable)
- **Pico 4 Drivers**: Headset-specific drivers and utilities

### Performance Targets
- **Minimum**: 72 FPS stable framerate
- **Target**: 90 FPS with room for frame drops
- **Latency**: <20ms motion-to-photon latency

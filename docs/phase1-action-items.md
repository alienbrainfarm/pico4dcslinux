  - [ ] Note any blockers or compatibility issues
  - [ ] Plan Week 2 activities based on findings

## Week 2: DCS Testing & Integration

### Day 8-9: DCS World Installation
- [ ] **Wine Prefix Setup**
  - [ ] Create dedicated Wine prefix for DCS: `WINEPREFIX=~/dcs-wine winecfg`
  - [ ] Configure Wine prefix for Windows 10 compatibility
  - [ ] Install necessary Windows libraries via Winetricks
  - [ ] Test Wine prefix basic functionality

- [ ] **DCS World Installation**
  - [ ] Download DCS World installer
  - [ ] Install DCS World in Wine prefix
  - [ ] Document installation process and any issues
  - [ ] Test basic DCS World startup (non-VR mode)

### Day 10-11: Initial VR Integration Testing
- [ ] **Basic VR Testing**
  - [ ] Test simple VR applications through Wine
  - [ ] Attempt VR runtime detection in Wine
  - [ ] Test VR headset detection through Wine
  - [ ] Document VR integration findings

- [ ] **DCS VR Mode Testing**
  - [ ] Attempt to enable VR mode in DCS settings
  - [ ] Test VR mode activation
  - [ ] Document any VR-specific issues with DCS
  - [ ] Test performance in VR mode (if functional)

### Day 12-13: Performance & Optimization
- [ ] **Performance Baseline**
  - [ ] Test DCS non-VR performance through Wine
  - [ ] Measure system resource utilization
  - [ ] Test various graphics settings
  - [ ] Document performance characteristics

- [ ] **VR Performance Testing**
  - [ ] Test VR application performance through Wine
  - [ ] Measure frame rates and latency
  - [ ] Test different VR settings and configurations
  - [ ] Document VR performance findings

### Day 14: Phase 1 Completion
- [ ] **Final Documentation**
  - [ ] Complete Phase 1 research findings document
  - [ ] Document all successful configurations
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - [ ] Update implementation plan based on findings

- [ ] **Phase 2 Preparation**
  - [ ] Assess viability of current approach
  - [ ] Identify major blockers for Phase 2
  - [ ] Recommend path forward for Phase 2
  - [ ] Create handoff documentation

## Critical Success Path

### Must-Have Outcomes
1. **Wine-staging + DCS working** (non-VR) - If this fails, project is not viable
2. **Basic VR runtime functional** - Need either Monado or ALVR working
3. **Pico 4 connectivity established** - Either USB or wireless connection
4. **Performance baseline established** - Know what performance is possible

### Nice-to-Have Outcomes
1. **DCS VR mode partially functional** - Even basic VR rendering
2. **ALVR streaming working** - Wireless VR option validated
3. **Optimization strategies identified** - Performance improvement paths
4. **Community validation** - Others can reproduce results

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Wine Installation Issues
```bash
# Remove old Wine installation
sudo apt remove wine* winehq*
# Clean Wine directories
rm -rf ~/.wine
# Reinstall Wine-staging
sudo apt install winehq-staging
```

#### VR Runtime Issues
```bash
# Check OpenXR runtime status
echo $XR_RUNTIME_JSON
# Test basic VR functionality
# (commands depend on installed runtime)
```

#### DCS Installation Issues
```bash
# Check Wine prefix
WINEPREFIX=~/dcs-wine wine winecfg
# Test Wine functionality
WINEPREFIX=~/dcs-wine wine notepad
```

## Emergency Fallback Plans

### If Wine VR Support Fails
1. Focus on non-VR DCS optimization
2. Research Windows VM with GPU passthrough
3. Investigate native Linux alternatives

### If Pico 4 Support Fails
1. Test with other VR headsets (Quest 2, etc.)
2. Focus on ALVR wireless streaming approach
3. Research USB driver development options

### If Performance is Inadequate
1. Test on higher-end hardware
2. Focus on optimization techniques
3. Consider dual-boot recommendation
